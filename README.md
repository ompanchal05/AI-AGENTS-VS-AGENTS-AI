# AI Agent vs Agent AI – Complete Learning Roadmap

This repository provides a complete learning plan for understanding and building both types of agents:

1. AI Agents – Traditional autonomous agents using classical AI or reinforcement learning.
2. Agent AI – LLM-powered agents using modern language models like ChatGPT, LangChain, and AutoGen.

You can follow either path or both, depending on your interest. There is no fixed number of days — progress at your own pace.

## 1. What is the Difference?

| Feature           | AI Agent                                  | Agent AI                                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Definition        | An autonomous system that perceives, decides, and acts in an environment | A tool powered by large language models (LLMs) that can perform tasks via conversation, planning, or APIs |
| Core Input        | Environment state, sensors                 | User prompt, API data, document inputs         |
| Logic             | Decision rules, search algorithms, learning policies | Prompt engineering, language model reasoning   |
| Examples          | Maze solver, self-driving car agent, RL bot | ChatGPT tool use, task assistant, AI co-pilot  |
| Frameworks        | Python, Gym, NumPy, PyTorch                | LangChain, OpenAI, AutoGen, CrewAI             |
