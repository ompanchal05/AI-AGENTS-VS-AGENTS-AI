| Day | Topic                        | What You’ll Learn / Do                                        |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ | **Intro to AI Agents**       | What is an AI agent, types (reflex, goal-based, learning)     |
| 2️⃣ | **PEAS & Architecture**      | Define agents using PEAS (Performance, Environment, etc.)     |
| 3️⃣ | **Simple Reflex Agent**      | Build a reflex agent in Python (e.g., vacuum cleaner bot)     |
| 4️⃣ | **Goal-Based Agent**         | Use search algorithms (BFS, DFS) to build a pathfinder        |
| 5️⃣ | **Utility & Learning Agent** | Intro to Q-learning and reward-based decision making          |
| 6️⃣ | **Environment Simulation**   | Simulate agents in environments (e.g., OpenAI Gym - CartPole) |
| 7️⃣ | **Chatbot Agent**            | Build a rule-based conversational AI agent (NLP)              |
| 8️⃣ | **Final Project & Wrap-Up**  | Create your own custom agent + document + GitHub setup        |
